## Hypothesis
Movies directed by James Cameron gross more than movies not directed by James Cameron.

```{r}

movieRaw <- read.csv("movie_metadata_genre_FORCLASS.csv", header = TRUE, dec = ".")

movieCameron <- movieRaw[movieRaw$director_name == "JamesCameron",]

movieNoCameron <- movieRaw[movieRaw$director_name != "JamesCameron",]

t.test(movieCameron$gross, movieNoCameron$gross, var.equal = F)

hist(movieNoCameron$gross)
hist(movieCameron$gross)
```
